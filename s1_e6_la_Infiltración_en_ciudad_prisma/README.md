# S1E6 - La Infiltraci√≥n en Ciudad Prisma: Un Desaf√≠o para los Maestros de Datos üèôÔ∏è

[View Challenge](https://makers-challenge.altscore.ai/s1e6)

## The Challenge
In a remote corner of the Pok√©mon world, Prisma City has remained closed to trainers and Pok√©mon for decades. To gain access, you must demonstrate your mastery of Pok√©mon data handling by solving the guardians' challenge.

### Your Mission
Calculate the average height of all Pok√©mon types, in alphabetical order, with a precision of 3 decimal places.

## The Solution
The solution involves querying the PokeAPI to obtain data for all Pok√©mon, processing their heights by type, and calculating the required averages.

### Implementation
The `summit_solution.py` script performs the following actions:
1. Queries the PokeAPI to retrieve all Pok√©mon
2. Collects the heights and types of each Pok√©mon
3. Calculates the average height by type
4. Sends the results to the solution endpoint

### Solution Code
```python
# Simplified code - see summit_solution.py for the complete implementation
import requests
from collections import defaultdict

def calculate_average_heights():
    # Query all Pok√©mon
    url = "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon"
    all_pokemon = []
    
    # Paginate through all Pok√©mon
    while url:
        response = requests.get(url)
        data = response.json()
        all_pokemon.extend(data['results'])
        url = data['next']
    
    # Process heights by type
    type_heights = defaultdict(list)
    for pokemon in all_pokemon:
        details = requests.get(pokemon['url']).json()
        for type_info in details['types']:
            type_name = type_info['type']['name']
            type_heights[type_name].append(details['height'])
    
    # Calculate averages
    avg_heights = {}
    for type_name, heights in sorted(type_heights.items()):
        avg_heights[type_name] = round(sum(heights) / len(heights), 3)
    
    return avg_heights
```

### Results
The average heights by type are:

```json
{
    "heights": {
        "bug": 19.529,
        "dark": 20.064,
        "dragon": 43.374,
        "electric": 16.491,

    }
}
```

### Execution
```bash
python summit_solution.py
```
